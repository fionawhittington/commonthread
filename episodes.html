							<p>
							This episode features a conversation with recent Boston University graduate Maya Gazhal, who shares his experiences and perspectives about spending a summer in Palestine as an activist, teacher and IT guy. Given how controversial and charged the topic of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is, we approached this episode with the intent of understanding why one of our peers would go to Palestine and what he observed while he was there. We hope you find it interesting, as we did. The views articulated in this interview are those of the speaker and are not representative of the opinions of the Common Thread Podcast and Howard Thurman Center

							<p>
							The Republican Party is now in power across our federal government, holds the majority of governorships and of state legislative bodies. Yet, in the wake of President Trump's rise and all the coverage of his personality and character, it can seem like we're still an election season rather than a season of governance. We wanted to drive to the root of substantive issues so we spoke with Corey Pray, President of BU College Republicans, and Anastasia Koartes, Secretary of BU College Republicans. This discussion covers a lot of ground, from the diversity of conservative thought, Republican methods of appealing to millennials, foreign policy, and other prevalent issues.

							<p>
							HTC Ambassador Yash Kothari sat down with Noam Chomsky because he had the guts to simply email him and ask for an appointment. This initiative fascinated us, so we asked Yash to talk. Yash, who will graduate in May, has a totally unique philosophy on independent learning in college. Spin this Thread if you want to hear about how you might also become an ambitious learner too.

							<p>
							Listen to us talk with Marwa Sayed, a student activist who launched a petition late last year to make BU a 'sanctuary campus'. We define actions cities and campuses can take, discuss the potential limitations and delve into the way activism is changing by the day as events unfold.

							<p>
							After sixteen years of existence, the refugee camp known as "the Jungle" of Calais, Northern France was dismantled in October leaving hundreds of men, women, and children in a precarious position as their dream to reach the UK was put on halt. We interview BU student Smaranda Tolosano who visited the “Jungle” of Calais a few days before its evacuation and followed the early stages of the government-orchestrated shutdown.

							<p>
							Martin Luther King Jr. is tragically misrepresented as a simple idealist who offered moving oratory. In truth, he was much more than this. He was a revolutionary leader who evolved to face the challenges posed to his movement and offered radical proposals to solve the plight of the poor. Listen to us discuss the final years of his life based on extensive research and conversations with Reverend Julian Cook and Mr. Ryan Hendrickson.
