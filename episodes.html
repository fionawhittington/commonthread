          		<p>
              Team members Erin and Patrick met Diane Gallagher, the Nursing Archivist at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center. We learned that not only did she serve in the Peace Corps in Cape Verde when she was 53, but won the Lillian Carter Award from President Jimmy Carter and has met with Michelle Obama.
    					</p><p>
      					 Her book, Lure of Service (now on the shelves of the Howard Thurman Center), is an entertaining memoir of her time in Cape Verde - the projects she worked on, who she loved, and what she learned from the Cape Verdeans. A New York City native, Diane now is a host mother for Harvard's international student program and continues to be involved with the Peace Corps. We sat down and chatted about her beliefs on whining, grit, learning about other cultures, caring for people, humility, and what BU means when it says we need to be global citizens. We hope you enjoy her insight and jaw-dropping stories as much as we did.​

							Chicago has come up frequently in the national political conversation, mostly to serve as a negative example for everything that’s wrong with the country and society today. Matthias sat down with Reverend Julian Cook for the first episode of a series on Chicago’s history from 1966 to present day. This episode focuses on the social conditions that motivated MLK JR to take the Civil Rights movement to Chicago, the turbulence of the sixties, and Chicago as an economic hub amongst other things.

							<p>
							Today, on the 50th anniversary of MLK’s historic “Beyond Vietnam” address, The Common Thread podcast is re-releasing a segment of our very first episode. On April 4th of last year, we looked at the radicalism of MLK between 1965 and 1968. This segment concerns the context of the "Beyond Vietnam" speech, its content and its fallout. 
							</p><p>
  							If you’d like to listen to more of our MLK content beyond this segment, you can scroll down in our archive to the very first episode. The segment you hear here is from 22 to 35 minutes in.

							<p>
							When considering major issues like housing affordability and gentrification, it is the challenge of the city planner to recognize the fine line between furthering economic development and preserving historically cultural and ethnic communities and institutions. On a trip to New York, fellow team member Varsha got to sit down with Purnima Kapur, the Executive Director of City Planning of New York City, where they discussed the city's current policy addressing these issues as well as other resolutions in resiliency and sustainability. Spin this thread to hear insights from the woman behind the development of one of the world's biggest cities.

							<p>
							Recently, the Climate Leadership Council brought together some prominent establishment conservatives––including several former cabinet officials––to release a novel plan to combat climate change: "The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends". This prompted us to sit down with James Baldwin, a lecturer in the Earth and Environment Department at Boston University. We discuss his ongoing research, explore the range of possible outcomes for the species and analyze this plan in its political context.

							<p>
							This episode features a conversation with recent Boston University graduate Maya Gazhal, who shares his experiences and perspectives about spending a summer in Palestine as an activist, teacher and IT guy. Given how controversial and charged the topic of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is, we approached this episode with the intent of understanding why one of our peers would go to Palestine and what he observed while he was there. We hope you find it interesting, as we did.

							<p>
							The Republican Party is now in power across our federal government, holds the majority of governorships and of state legislative bodies. Yet, in the wake of President Trump's rise and all the coverage of his personality and character, it can seem like we're still an election season rather than a season of governance. We wanted to drive to the root of substantive issues so we spoke with Corey Pray, President of BU College Republicans, and Anastasia Koartes, Secretary of BU College Republicans. This discussion covers a lot of ground, from the diversity of conservative thought, Republican methods of appealing to millennials, foreign policy, and other prevalent issues.

We interview BU student Smaranda Tolosano who visited the “Jungle” of Calais a few days before its evacuation and followed the early stages of the government-orchestrated shutdown.

							<p>
							Martin Luther King Jr. is tragically misrepresented as a simple idealist who offered moving oratory. In truth, he was much more than this. He was a revolutionary leader who evolved to face the challenges posed to his movement and offered radical proposals to solve the plight of the poor. Listen to us discuss the final years of his life based on extensive research and conversations with Reverend Julian Cook and Mr. Ryan Hendrickson.
