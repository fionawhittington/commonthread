            <title>Martin Luther King - His Last Years</title>
            <description>Martin Luther King Jr. is tragically misrepresented as a simple idealist who offered moving oratory. In truth, he was much more than this. He was a revolutionary leader who evolved to face the challenges posed to his movement and offered radical proposals to solve the plight of the poor. Listen to us discuss the final years of his life based on extensive research and conversations with Reverend Julian Cook and Mr. Ryan Hendrickson.</description>

            <description>Listen to us talk with Marwa Sayed, a student activist who launched a petition late last year to make BU a 'sanctuary campus'. We define actions cities and campuses can take, discuss the potential limitations and delve into the way activism is changing by the day as events unfold.

            <title>BU College Republicans</title>
            <description>The Republican Party is now in power across our federal government, holds the majority of governorships and of state legislative bodies. Yet, in the wake of President Trump's rise and all the coverage of his personality and character, it can seem like we're still an election season rather than a season of governance. We wanted to drive to the root of substantive issues so we spoke with Corey Pray, President of BU College Republicans, and Anastasia Koartes, Secretary of BU College Republicans. This discussion covers a lot of ground, from the diversity of conservative thought, Republican methods of appealing to millennials, foreign policy, and other prevalent issues.</description>

            <title>Summer in Palestine</title>
            <description>This episode features a conversation with recent Boston University graduate Maya Gazhal, who shares his experiences and perspectives about spending a summer in Palestine as an activist, teacher and IT guy. Given how controversial and charged the topic of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is, we approached this episode with the intent of understanding why one of our peers would go to Palestine and what he observed while he was there. We hope you find it interesting, as we did. The views articulated in this interview are those of the speaker and are not representative of the opinions of the Common Thread Podcast and Howard Thurman Center.</description>

            <title>Conservative Climate Action</title>
            <description>Recently, the Climate Leadership Council brought together some prominent establishment conservatives––including several former cabinet officials––to release a novel plan to combat climate change: "The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends". This prompted us to sit down with James Baldwin, a lecturer in the Earth and Environment Department at Boston University. We discuss his ongoing research, explore the range of possible outcomes for the species and analyze this plan in its political context.</description>
