            <title>Martin Luther King - His Last Years</title>
            <description>Martin Luther King Jr. is tragically misrepresented as a simple idealist who offered moving oratory. In truth, he was much more than this. He was a revolutionary leader who evolved to face the challenges posed to his movement and offered radical proposals to solve the plight of the poor. Listen to us discuss the final years of his life based on extensive research and conversations with Reverend Julian Cook and Mr. Ryan Hendrickson.</description>

            <title>Independent Learning</title>
            <description>HTC Ambassador Yash Kothari sat down with Noam Chomsky because he had the guts to simply email him and ask for an appointment.
